README:

There are two R program files. One for iris and income datasets. The following are the things that needs to be done
for each of the files before running them.

1. In the first 2 lines, type the path where the test and training datasets (income or iris depending on the program you 
   open) can be found on your computer.
2. In the third line, type the path where you want the final output file(.csv) to be stored.
3. For the program with the income dataset, there will be fifth and sixth lines which would have been commented. This subsets the income training and testing 
   data to the first 100 rows. Since the program takes a while to finish computing for all the rows, you can choose to run the program only for the first 
   100 rows by uncommenting this line. THis will make the program run faster.
4. Run the all the functions (euclid, manhat and knn).
5. In the fourth last line, you can set the value of k (it's 3 currently) and set the proximity type in 
   the knn function call to obtain the corresponding result.
6. The output can be seen as a csv file saved on the path mentioned in 2. Alternatively, the dataframe 'results' 
   has the final results. You can choose to view that dataframe in R directly.


Thanks! :)
